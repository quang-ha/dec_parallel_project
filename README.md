A repository for Parallel Programming Project on Discrete Exterior Calculus.

You need to have [SpectrA](https://spectralib.org/) header files, which also requires [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). After download them, the environment variables need to be set to:

```
export EIG_DIR=\link\to\eigen-3.3.4\include
export SPECTRA_DIR=\link\to\spectra
```

The source code can then be compiled with `make all`.
